Please refrain from using it in your life, that is wrong to all the people who lost their lifes. I sincerely hope you learn from this mistake and no longer make the same choice again. Please evaluate your life choices, and question yourself to why you decided to use the skull emoji. I understand that you may have been through alot, but that does not mean you should joke about dead people. You may have been abused or hurt, but do not use that as an excuse to hurt others. If i ever catch you using offensive things again, so help me god i will find you. I will find you myself. I swear on my brothers grave that i will stop at no cost. You are my enemy.

Simple Flu Symptoms/pneumonia symptoms are being treated as a new virus called corona(plasma). People are dying of other cause but deaths are being labeled ‚ÄúCorona virus‚Äù. People are getting tested and results are giving false positive all to push a agenda to keep people sleep for this mass awakening so they can push vaccines and control us more than how they already try to control us now. Also dosen‚Äôt take a doctor to know mucus cause any and every disease if you pump the body with straight VITAMIN C you can heal from ANY DISEASE instead they hook tubes to you to kill oxygen, use drugs to kill you slowly, makes body dependent of it, and also keep US SPENDING MONEY WHEN WE CAN HEAL OURSELVES NATURALLY FROM ANY DISEASE USING HERBS, POWER OF MINDS, AND VIBRATION/ ENERGY EXERCISES ‚ÄºÔ∏è Can go furthermore but im choosing to stop it here. Be ready for vaccines to be in-forced hard this month and for us to stay home this month also be prepared for a false report on alien invasion.
