They want 100% of that revenue but what they don't realize is that a large percentage of users will quit before they switch off their preferred app. It would be better to capture 30% of those users than to jeopardize the entire site trying to cut out the developers who acquired many of these users in the first place.",

When I read it the when it was first written I absolutely agreed with Joel, the rewritten version of netscape was absolutely atrocious.\n\nHowever ten years later the decision to rewrite was completely vindicated with the success of firefox. Joels was then dead wrong. Mozilla would not have succeeded in making an IE killer tied to the very brittle code base of the original netscape browser.\n\nToday the field is even more interesting, mozilla has a very interesting rewrite project with Servo. Now I think Joels main point stands, a lot of the instinct programmers have for wanting a rewrite is because it is much harder to read code than to write.

I 100% stand by my decision. The increase in productivity was invaluable. The code base is now less than 30k lines. Don't haphazardly rewrite your entire codebase, but don't take this article too seriously either.\n\n\nEdit: I realized I wasn't counting the templates in the RoR app while the templates in the PHP app were all included in my initial count. And in an effort to be fair, a more accurate total for the RoR app actually stands at 41k lines. While going back to investigate I also found that the PHP app had a 25 line license in almost every file, amounting to roughly 86k lines of license.",

I'm not saying throw out the code every time but there needs to be a line drawn at some point.\n\nCase in point some of our in house software is in **VB6**; It uses controls that have no 64 bit version ocx because whoever made the controls stopped existing before 64 bit os and I'm not even sure we could get them working registered on windows 7 32 bit for that matter. This means we have to have a windows XP VM in our pool in order to make bug fixes or update features and hope to god nothing happens to corrupt that box and its backups. \n\nIt also means I can't install VB6 into a more recent version of windows to run debug in an environment that matches what one of my users has. Instead when I want to debug something I'm not experiencing on DEV I have to add a ton of Msgboxes that yell various profanities where I THINK the crash might be and see which profanity doesn't pop up. Had an instance where the user changed his region settings to french, and it Borked a CDATE() somewhere because it didn't know how to deal with the french version of the Month.\n\nThe programs talk to a set of access databases and has some of the most convoluted code I've ever seen. I hate that code with a passion, doesn't mean I can't read it, it's just retarded.  \n\nFor instance whoever coded this originally made a Replace function that overwrites the built in Replace function with a significantly worse one that is prone to infinite loops, because why the fuck not?\n\nOr how about the fact that every table is loaded into a \"temporary\" table before being read.\n\nseriously...\n\nEverywhere in the code there is a call to a function that drops tblTemp followed by a select \\* into tblTemp from **whatever table they need at the time** no joins or anything fancy like that and THEN the code does a select \\* from tbltemp where **blahblahblabedyblah**.\n\nThis software runs at over 60 locations across the country, I have to interrupt these people's workdays for 20-30 minutes to run fucking compact and repairs in access at 99.9% of these locations on a weekly basis because they run the risk of hitting the 2 gig database limit.\n\nNot to mention every SQL command you have to write has to take into consideration the fact access is a \"special needs\" child and doesn't like to follow normal conventions. It's the Internet Explorer of databases.\n\nThere is stuff in there that has 100's of lines of buggy code doing things which I could do in 20.\n\nHave I mentioned it's VB6 code yet? Yes I have. Know what that means?  No Try/Catch. Error handling/logging is shoddy at best and non existent in most cases.\n\nHere's the thing, I can read old code fine... the problem is that it reads like the fucking Twilight Series...",

It can be fun. It is also, from a business standpoint, safe and cheap.\n\nFast, safe, cheap: choose any three. How often do you get an opportunity like that in engineering?\n\nSomething Spolsky doesn't mention here, but something I've noticed in my own projects: What you recognize as \"cruft\" in old code that someone else wrote often turns out to be, on much closer examination, \"features.\" It's not until you examine it in the kind of detail required for a rewrite that you realize all the subtleties of the way Feature A and Feature B interact with each other. Your rewrite might be slightly cleaner than the original, but it's not going to be the sleek glistening monument to your own genius and discipline you imagined when you started, because the interaction between A and B just turns out to be complicated.

It is designed to be used with a low cost (around $100) eye-tracking device to bring keyboard control, mouse control and speech to people with motor and speech limitations, such as people living with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) / Motor Neuron Disease (MND).\n\n>It works out of the box once you have your eye-tracking device installed and allows selections to be made using dwell selection, as well as physical buttons and assistive devices. If you do not have an eye tracking device you can use OptiKey with a mouse.\n\n>OptiKey was written to challenge the outrageously expensive, unreliable and difficult to use AAC (alternative and augmentative communication) products on the market. It is, therefore, fully open-source and free. Forever.\n\n>Video: https://youtu.be/HLkyORh7vKk\nWebsite: https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki\n\n>I'd love to hear your feedback.\n\n>Julius",

You can probably increase the typing speed by having the user execute a gesture on screen. I would suggest by exiting one of the edges of the screen which then acts as enter for the tracked hit keys.\n\n\nYou might want to include this document for people who cannot afford the two trackers you suggested: http://www.mkowalik.pl/et/How%20to%20build%20low%20cost%20eyetracking%20glasses.pdf\n\nIt is very straight forward to build such a tracker. Combined with the ITUGazeTracker this should lead to a decent result. Let me know if you want me to contribute instructions.\n\n\nGreat job!\n",

I could imagine that Google just decided to try as hard as possible to patent whatever the fuck they can about this important new technology... if they fail, they at least made (relatively) certain that nobody else can later do it either.\n\nThe best option for the inventor would've probably been to patent it himself and grant the world an irrevokable royalty-free license, rather than not patenting it at all. Patents are not free, unfortunately, but it seems that he cares enough about this that he might have been willing to put out the money.

No one particularly likes them, but they have to maintain an arsenal of them for deterrence reasons. This disincentives large firms from suing one another non-stop, since it would carry a near-certain counter-suit. If you don't like software patents, you can go yell at the USPTO.

It's also why companies don't need to open source their whole infrastructure for using a PostgresQL daemon or running their servers on a GPL-licensed Linux distribution. If they were instead running on a modified version of that operating system, they'd be obliged to open source said derivative software. As an aside, this is partly why FreeBSD and OpenBSD are quite popular: the BSD license is quite permissive of forks. It's quite common for companies to start customizing their operating systems as their scale starts to warrant it.\n\n**TL;DR:** Using GPL-licensed software for closed source purposes is legal, so long as you're not (say for example) forking it to make some changes and extensions for your closed source purposes. If you do that, you must open source your fork (or face intellectual property violations).

We wanted to make sure the community could keep the site alive should the company go under and making the code available was the logical thing to do\n\nTranslation: We needed you guys back then. We don't now.\n\nThe rest of it seems like a combination of technical hurdles that don't seem particularly compelling (they don't need to have secret new feature branches in their public repo) and some that don't make any sense (how does a move away from a monolithic repo into microservices change anything?) and some that are comical (our shit's so complicated to deploy and use that you can't use it anyway)\n\nIt's sad that their development processes have effectively resulted in administrative reasons they can't do it. I remember them doing shenanigans like using their single-point-of-failure production RabbitMQ server to run the untested April fools thing this year (r/place) and in doing so almost brought everything down. So I'm not surprised that there doesn't seem to be much maturity in the operations and development processes over there.\n\nTo be fair though, the reddit codebase always had a reputation for being such a pain that it wasn't really useful for much. Thankfully, their more niche open source contributions, while not particularly polished and documented, might end up being more useful than the original reddit repo. I know I've been meaning to look into the Websocket one.",

Such balkanization means that merges are getting increasingly difficult, especially as the company grows and more developers are touching the code more frequently.\n\nSo in effect, they made a private fork of their own code and it's now diverged to the point where they can't feasibly maintain both.\n\nIt's sad but I suppose inevitable when your business model involves using your code rather than giving it to other people and selling support. Any users of your code are not potential customers but competitors.\n\nHowever, since their source apparently remains available under a semi-free copyleft license (CPAL), maybe there will be a community-maintained fork of some kind.",

If, in your example, video was the *only* thing being worked on at a given time, then sure, that would be easy.  But if it's not (and really, what company is only doing one thing at a time), now someone has to go cherry-pick all the commits that were video-related, make sure they don't contain anything not video-related, make sure they don't rely on anything not video-related, redo all the testing, fix anything that was missing from those commits, and hope that nothing else changed while they were doing all the above.  That alone is a full-time job, and not a fun one.\n\nI mean, isn't this precisely what branches are for? Serious question because I've never work on a large team. It seems they only have master, testing, and dev branches. Wouldn't it make sense to dev videos in one branch and secretx in another when you have 100 devs? ",

After all if your source code is already open and then it turns out you don’t even own your site content what unique assets do you actually **have**? reddit has always argued that they own a license to their user’s submissions but if this ruling weakens that argument then they probably have to take some steps to mollify their investors.\n\nEdit: for accuracy",

This is a pretty consistent trend in Internet communities and is known as the 1% rule.\n> \n> But there's more, because not all the users who post do so with the same frequency. The 1% rule is of course just another way of saying that the distribution of contributions follows a Power Law Distribution, which means that the level of inequality gets more drastic as you look at smaller subsets of users. \n\n> Inequalities are also found on Wikipedia, where more than 99% of users are lurkers. According to Wikipedia's \"about\" page, it has only 68,000 active contributors, which is 0.2% of the 32 million unique visitors it has in the U.S. alone.\n> \n> **Wikipedia's most active 1,000 people — 0.003% of its users — contribute about two-thirds of the site's edits. Wikipedia is thus even more skewed than blogs, with a 99.8–0.2–0.003 rule.**\n\n---\n\n> I found one [Amazon] reviewer with 20.8k reviews since 2011. That's just under **3,000 reviews per year, which comes out to around 8 per day.** This man has written an average of 8 reviews on Amazon per day, all of the ones I see about books, every day for seven years. I thought it might be some bot account writing fake reviews in exchange for money, but if it is then it's a really good bot because Grady Harp is a real person whose job matches that account's description. And my skimming of some reviews **looked like they were all relevant to the book, and he has the \"verified purchase\" tag on all of them, which also means he's probably actually reading them.**\n> \n> **The only explanation for this behavior is that he is insane. I mean, normal people don't do that. We read maybe 20 books a year, tops, and we probably don't write reviews on Amazon for all of them. There has to be something wrong with this guy.**\n\n> He's less prominent now, but YouTube power-user Justin Y. had a top comment on pretty much every video you clicked on for like a year. He says he spends 1-3 hours per day commenting on YouTube, finds videos by looking at the statistics section of the site to see which are spiking in popularity, and comments on a lot of videos without watching them. Maybe he's not quite insane, but he's clearly interacting the site in a way that's different than most people, essentially optimizing for comment likes.\n> \n> **If you read reviews on Amazon, you're mostly reading reviews written by people like Grady Harp. If you read Wikipedia, you're mostly reading articles written by people like Justin Knapp. If you watch Twitch streamers, you're mostly watching people like Tyler Blevins. And if you read YouTube comments, you're mostly reading comments written by people like Justin Young. If you consume any content on the Internet, you're mostly consuming content created by people who for some reason spend most of their time and energy creating content on the Internet. And those people clearly differ from the general population in important ways.**",

So it might be that your router does not require security updates. We strongly advise you to contact your vendor for more details. In general though, you can try to mitigate attacks against routers and access points by disabling client functionality (which is for example used in repeater modes) and disabling 802.11r (fast roaming). For ordinary home users, your priority should be updating clients such as laptops and smartphones.\n\nSo it looks like patching only the clients (laptops/smartphones) could be enough?",

It also has the trademark advantage that lets it be _the_ reddit app in app stores, it can push itself from the website, and can appeal to people who want reddit to get that ad revenue.\n\nSo even without locking down any APIs or forcing subscription fees, the reddit app _should_ be able compete. We'd expect third party apps to be so niche that they shouldn't matter much to reddit's bottom line.\n\nBut no.

We will remove Flash completely from Chrome toward the end of 2020.\n\nMozilla: \n\n> Starting next month, users will choose which websites are able to run the Flash plugin. Flash will be disabled by default for most users in 2019, and only users running the Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR) will be able to continue using Flash through the final end-of-life at the end of 2020. In order to preserve user security, once Flash is no longer supported by Adobe security patches, no version of Firefox will load the plugin.\n\nMicrosoft:\n\n> - In mid to late 2018, we will update Microsoft Edge to require permission for Flash to be run each session. Internet Explorer will continue to allow Flash for all sites in 2018.\n> - In mid to late 2019, we will disable Flash by default in both Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer. Users will be able to re-enable Flash in both browsers. When re-enabled, Microsoft Edge will continue to require approval for Flash on a site-by-site basis.\n> - By the end of 2020, we will remove the ability to run Adobe Flash in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer across all supported versions of Microsoft Windows. Users will no longer have any ability to enable or run Flash.\n\nLooks like Flash will be completely dead by the end of 2020.",

Without Code. \n\nThe important thing about flash was it allowed _Graphic Artists_ to maintain control of their art and animation. It was the early days when artists still had a voice in the game.\n\nAs flash progressed, it was overtaken by web coders, because the BigBusiness machine needed more power, and they hired coders to corrupt flash and make it more and more code based, and discounting the graphic interface that made it so great in the early days.\n\nSince then, web creation has moved from art and design, over to coders. Coders won the war, which is why every website on my iPhone looks nearly identical: Divs, Columns, Boxes. This is what coders wanted, not what artists wanted. It went from being something really cool and fluid, to something boxy and boring. \n\nI am sad it will go, but maybe it's like Photography: when black and white photography, developed on film and printed in high grain on Ilford paper meant something artistically, and it was creatively important. Now photography is a Instagram square enjoyed for a millisecond. \n\n\nRIP Flash. Hope we can get a new graphic interface soon...",

I have to sympathize with FB here, they spent billions to be able to serve nearly the whole world population, who voluntarily signed up, and now they want their investment to give returns... by clearing the newsfeed, you made their product better for users, but useless to FB... why would FB want people to use their product in a way that generates no revenue to them?\n\nObjecting that is only possible if you think of FB as some kind of non-profit, charity or at least a public service... which they are patently not. They are your typical for-profit, multi-billion dollar corporation which has no reason to do anything at all that's not going to generate profit.

I feel we should be using them to replace human-replayed secrets (passwords) for logins. But the threat model these are best for are for situations where the actor WANTS to be part of security. They don't want the system to be fooled. So the human will not share their key. Will not press the finger pad when they don't want to authenticate.\n\nWith these human-detection processes the actor WANTS to beat the system. The actor is a bad actor and is trying to pass off their machine as a human (or a machine in this case).

If so, that could be a huge issue to deal with.\n\nRegardless, I hope the people taking these decisions have calculated and evaluated all potential risks which might be associated with such a move, and even if they have not, it's an open playground for others to learn from mistakes.",

But practically speaking, there will be ways to circumvent it and render it ineffective in its goal of providing quality and transparency. I currently work with a software product that (according to that company's lawyers) meets the US government's requirements to be considered open source. The problem is that the open source version is roughly a year out of date, has about 10-20% of the true functionality, and you have to jump through hoops to get your hands on a copy. Even then, it doesn't compile and run correctly without you having to figure out the problems yourself. \n\nThe truth is the that company doesn't care about the spirit of open source. To them, it's just a checkbox that they can legally check to get preferential treatment on government contracts. The product that the government (and other clients) pay for and receive is essentially unrelated to the published version. \n\nSo here is a real example where a product being \"open source\" doesn't really do anything. To be clear, I am not advocating that this new law is bad. Open source is good! I firmly believe that. But I wanted to provide a real life example where these laws can be skirted around. In this case, neither the government or the product creators really care that the open source label is a farce. Everyone willful turns a blind eye because it meets (what I'm told are) the minimum requirements. ",

Should it just be a generic career interview? Then it favors people who are more personable provides greater opportunity for bias. Should people get take homes? That is even more of a time commitment on the part of the candidate. Should we de-emphasize the interview and rely more on experience? Then people who get bad jobs early in their career are in trouble for life. Should we go by referrals/letters of recommendation? Then it encourages nepotism.\n\nI am not saying we should never use any of these things, or that we should always use skills based interviews. I think we need to strike a balance between a lot of very imperfect options. But  honestly hiring just sucks and there is no silver bullet.",

                "Comment Body": "I wish engineers would spend less time talking about how _not_ to do tech interviews and more time talking about _how_ to do them, because I never get anything useful out of the former discussions. And when developers, such as those in this interview, talk about what to do, it's always vague, hand-wavy suggestions like \"ask a design question\" but never any specific examples that the rest of can supposedly learn from.\n\nHere's my hot take: No one in this industry knows how to hire a software developer, and if you are successful at doing so, you probably just get lucky from time to time, and most of your hires are mediocre, many are bad, but some are good enough that they keep the wheels on your company's bus, and then you go on podcasts and act like _you're_ the expert.\n\nDon't get me wrong: Leetcode-style questions are not great interview questions, and I never ask them. But look: a lot of developers can barely code, and the rest of the organization suffers because those developers bang out crappy code that no one else can understand and then it takes weeks or even months to understand and make even the smallest modifications to that crappy code, and that's if it actually _works_ and doesn't constantly wake up the on-call engineers at 4 AM. ChatGPT is so amazing because it really _can_ write better code than most software developers, but that's only because most developers write, at best, mediocre code.\n\nSo yes, a lot of tech interviews suck. But my God, saying it's inhumane to ask someone to demonstrate that they can do even a contrived part of their job is just so asinine. \"Developers\" want cushy, high-paying tech jobs but don't want to have to do anything for them. Being a software developer is maybe the easiest white-collar job. My girlfriend is a clinical pharmacist who right now is studying her ass off for her bi-yearly board re-certification in two months, on top of the all of the continuing education she has to do on a near-constant basis. My lawyer friends went to undergrad, then three years of _very expensive_ law school, and even then, they still had to pass the bar to even be allowed to write briefs for the senior lawyers at their firm. Shit, my dad was a freakin' _elementary school teacher_ who still had to go to continuing education classes and get recertified every few years just to teach fourth graders about the friggin' American Revolution. Meanwhile, in the tech industry, we don't require you to get an advanced degree; we don't require you to get a B.S. in comp sci; shit, we don't even require candidates to _have a degree_ anymore, because that's unfair. And you think it's bad—no, wait, _inhumane_—that you have to explain how to find three integers in an array such that a + b = c, so you can get a job that pays you $150k+?\n\nI've spent 10+ years reading these articles and the list of things I shouldn't do in a tech interview has grown long. I can't ask whiteboard coding questions, because some people get nervous during them. I can't ask brainteasers because they're useless. I can't give a take-home assignment because no one wants to do those, or has the time. I can't ask about prior experience because it's unfair to people who don't have a lot of experience. I can't ask about side projects because it's unfair to people who don't have time for side projects. I can't ask about open source contributes because not everyone has the time or inclination to contribute to open source projects. And don't get me wrong: I agree with many of those assessments, but if I take every software developer's preferences into account, I'm down to asking their name and that's about it (I also can't ask where they're from because that's offensive and might show that I'm biased against people from other places).\n\n(I could ask for more real-world problem that are symbolic of what I actually encounter during the work day, but then I'll be asking questions like, \"You have a Lambda function deployed across multiple regions, and it works in three of the four regions, but for some reason it doesn't work in one region. The function pulls messages from SQS and writes some data to Redshift. It is deployed into the same VPC as the Redshift cluster, which also has an SQS VPC endpoint, but the function is not working, but no errors are written into the Cloudwatch logs. Why not?\" but honestly, I think the candidates are going to like those questions far less than even a Leetcode-style interview.)\n\nSo by all means, let's get rid of the stupid brainteaser programming questions. But instead of using charged language like \"inhumane\", can we use more reasonable language like \"ineffective\"? And then instead of talking about what interview techniques don't work, can we discuss some that do? Can we agree that software developer candidates should have at least _some_ understanding of software development, and it's okay to ask them to demonstrate that knowledge?",

They work 20 hours a week and go to grad school for free, plus they get a salary.  \n\nThis guy would come in late, leave early, chat with his friends, never work late, and IT even caught him downloading movies...not the best worker...but students are hard to fire and I when he actually worked it was usable work so he was still a net plus for me so we kept him for the semester.\n\nAnyway, outside of work this dude was DRIVEN.  His dream was to work at Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft...you know the kinds of places with cafeterias, and a dozens of other perks...OH and a bunch of H-1B visas to hand out so foreigners remain in America while applying for their green card.\n\nEvery night after work and after school he would go home and work on solving interview exercises from those companies for **six hours a night**.  HOW did he know the exercises?  There was a Chinese website that he would visit where people that interviewed at those companies posted the questions they were asked.  And of course, they posted the solutions.  When this guy went on interviews at the end of the semester, he had literally already seen every single \"exercise\" that he'd be asked to do.  He knew them inside and out, could explain them, could talk about the \"gotchas\" etc...\n\nHis #1 choice was Google.  He kicked ass on interviews at Facebook and Microsoft already, but he really wanted Google.  He goes in and it's kind of a rigorous process.  You get interviewed by a bunch of people and they ALL have to agree to hire you because you'd be a good fit for the company.  He was crushing it, until he got to the last interviewer, and older Chinese man.  \n\nThe older Chinese man asked him to solve a problem, which this student knew of course, and solved it.  The older Chinese man says: \"You knew the answer already.  I can tell.  Will you admit it?\"  The student said he knew he was busted so admitting it would show honesty and he said, \"Yes.  I wanted to be prepared.\"  The older Chinese guy says \"you studying the exercises before the interview means I can't see how you work out a problem because you already know the answers.\"  The interview with that guy ended after the student tried to worm he was back into a \"good\" interview.\n\nThe student comes to me a few days later and says Google rejected me.  I think it was this racist Chinese guy.  He doesn't want other Chinese working there...he wants to be special, and he told me the story.\n\nAnyway this guy ended up taking a job at Amazon working on algorithm improvements.  He says it's boring but it pays well.\n\nI just thought this sub would find it interesting how much people actually prepare for these exercises, and how most companies fall for it.  Or maybe they don't \"Fall for it\" and think it's a good thing?  \n\nTLDR: I knew a kid that worked 6 hours a night for a semester on memorizing every exercise given by big companies...he got busted at his dream company, Google, and now works for Amazon.",

I got some training in ASP.Net 1.0 (in 2000) and they let me start building things. 17 years later and I still work in Visual Studio every day.",

Sometimes I've shared what I've done with my boss, and other times I haven't.. just depended on the relationship I had with my boss and my company. \n\nThat said, it is never unethical to not tell you're employer that you've automated your job unless the terms of your employment specifically included automation. When I've hired IT workers or developers in the past, I hired them at a price that was worth it to me to have specific work done, and wouldn't consider it theft in the slightest if they found a clever way to do their job quicker. Any company or boss that thought of it as theft are being unreasonable since in that case they should have understood the opportunity for automation on their own, and hired the programmer specifically to create that automation. The automation itself is a new invention, and although some states fall on one side or the other in terms of who owns new invention made while employed, in general, the less your idea relied on resources of your employer to implement, the better the case is that the new idea or invention is yours and not the company's. \n\nUltimately, tell them if you feel showing them your skills would lead to more opportunity. Or don't tell them if you don't trust them to not take your automation work and lay you off. But either way, you are not breaking any morals or laws by not telling them. \n\nOn the subject of faking errors to hide the fact you're automating. It would be better not to do that, but as long as you are producing equal or better results than you could do manually, it's still strictly \"moral\" in my view as an employer.. but if I hired you and found out about the fake errors, it wouldn't give me the best view of your character, and might taint my respect for the smarts it took to do the automation in the first place.

If he is an employee, then they can tell him how to do it, but the only info they've given so far seems to be \"don't change anything.\" In building in errors and delays, he has followed that policy. \n\nFinally, ethical dilemmas like this don't happen in a vacuum. \"Should I tell the truth?\" Well, it depends! Will telling the truth get you killed? Then don't. That's an extreme example to prove a point. If he tells the truth, his son's life will almost certainly get worse. They will have fewer resources, and more importantly, less time together. Let's say any lie is bad; it even damages your mortal soul.

Btw. over the whole data set there are alreadey more tab users (16682=32,5%) than spaces users (14666=28,5%).\n\n>So my conclusion is that space users probably earn more money as they have more experience, but the trend shows that the new generation tends to favor tabs and that there is already a majority of users who use tabs.",

They had Fennec, but Android comes pre-installed with Chrome. And Chrome is very well integrated in the Android operating system. As the mobile phone platform became dominating in statistics such as the one shown in this article, they also showed Chrome dominating.\n\nJust like how Microsoft is required to offer a choice of browser upon installation of Windows, there was an [antitrust suit](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/) against Google two years ago. Google is still appealing about it. There is a work-in-progress [choice screen](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-28/google-rival-attacks-search-giant-s-bid-to-stoke-android-choice) for search, but not for browsers.",

I had forgotten what a huge impact WHATWG had.\n\nThe web was moving at such a snail's pace under the W3C before them. Pumping out horror shows like XPath and XForms. Which weren't that bad on their own. However they were very enterprisy solutions. Big verbose markup that tries to do everything including curing cancer.\n\nIt wasn't just HTML5. It brought CSS3. JS started got cleaned up with proper classes, proper lambdas, and proper variables. We got a proper `<canvas>`, which helped lead towards WebGL. Most of all the browser vendors involved with WHATWG comitted to actually implementing this stuff. Which was huge.\n\nWHATWG was the tip of a big cultural shift in the web.\n\nHowever I think most of the things on this list shows that building cool stuff isn't enough on it's own. None of the items on this list resulted in Mozilla making more money. MDN is a really good example. Lots of companies would kill for ownership of something like that. For advertisements, upselling courses / books, or for recruitment.\n\nDevelopers often like to think they shouldn't be working for the man. Making money is bad. It's about the purity of creating amazing technologies in their own right. But that doesn't put food on the table. Without an income stream, you will end up laying off 250 employees as a part of a major restructuring.",

That’s the only reason - 4% market share is not worth $600m per year.\n\nSo, if your main funder is paying you half a billion per year that you’d prefer to spend on fancy flights and hotels, and the only thing that’s asked from you is to make sure that something opens up when you double-click the Firefox icon, why keep those pricey $200k/y Valley developers around?",

So, not having to spend roughly 3 hours on the road everyday is a big thing for me. If I had a considerably shorter, less stressful, drive, I wouldn't be as opposed. (Moving closer to the office isn't an option, due to a mix of high real estate prices and rising crime rates.)\n\nI also find the office to be an uncomfortable and noisy cube farm but I can deal with that, more or less.",

It's demoralizing and exhausting to lose that much work.\n\nRelatedly, I often wonder how to structure developer interaction in order to minimize the cost of interruptions, but still foster communication and coordination. There are a ton of approaches (pair programming, \"can I interrupt you\" protocols, structured coordination times), but none of them seem clearly better than others.",

Where you take a previously working site (though in this case I'm not sure how \"previously\" it was actually any good) and slowly drive it into the ground in the most profitable manner possible. Presumably you've done the math and figured that the potential profit from the site isn't likely to be worth the cost of upkeep and continued monetization efforts.\n\nSo rather than creating a long term plan that aims to have the site continuing to function for years to come, you come up with a plan that will make as much money as possible as quick as possible, with the least possible investment of time and/or money.\n\nOne of my buddies brothers used to do this. He would buy a website with an active community and then proceed to steadily increase the number of ads on the page until it eventually drove everyone away, by which point he'd have a new site lined up and would repeat the process.",

Hexagonal lattices, however, don't really suffer these problems; the hexagonal grid distances tend to very closely match the Euclidean distances.

Used to be that way back in the day.\n\nThe few times he could peak out from the water, he was a guy that had interesting ideas, loved his birds, and dreaded sinking back in. A drummer, passionate about programming and computers, on his good times he was a pleasant person to hang around (according to testimony), even if he was a bit of a hothead and never took criticism very well. \n\n...On his bad times, Terry was an awful racist guy, a volatile man that wanted to fight everything and everyone, lost in chaos and noise. Desperately programming an OS from the ground up because it made sense, or maybe it didn't, or maybe it helped him to make sense of his paranoia. Or maybe none of those answers.\n\nHis quote about the bird staring at a computer screen haunts me, and saddens me. \nTerry felt like his bird staring at a screen most of the time, he knew how his bird felt every day...and the times he was able to understand and \"be here\", he was the bird that understood what was on the screen, for once.

For some reason, so many companies think the best way to find a good candidate is to throw really hard questions (often times not even relevant to the job) at them to see if they fail.  It's like they want to make the candidate as nervous and uncomfortable as possible so they can get a view of them in a situation that doesn't in any way represent the job they will be doing.  \n\nI remember we were interviewing a candidate who was doing really well, but was clearly showing nerves.  One of our questions was intended to just make sure that she understood basic inheritance principles and she couldn't get it.  The way she was responding made it seem like she didn't understand the principals, but I could also see her hands shaking etc.  I stopped the question, moved on from it, and asked her an easier question on a topic I knew she was more familiar with that she aced.  After she aced it I went back to the question and said that I knew she knew the answer and I wanted her to look at it again, she got it right away once her nerves had toned down.\n\nI suck at interviews personally, but the best way to make me bomb an interview is to ask me off topic hard puzzle questions/problems that take a trick to solve.  I don't think well when put under that sort of pressure, but I'm not going to be put under that pressure on my job.  When given the chance to think things through when I'm relaxed I'm very good at solving those problems.  I want to see people I interview in their best form, not in their worst, and our questions are geared towards that.",

It had to be as syntactically correct as possible (we did ask them to choose their language, at least).\n\nIf you couldn't do this, even after we defined what a prime number was, it's a NO.  Sorry.\n\nThen, we'd ask them to abstract it, change it, improve on it.  It would help us get a handle on how much they know about their programming language of choice.  After all, it was something simple.\n\nWe'd use something like that to start the basis of our discussions to see if we liked the way the person reasoned:\n\n* would they lie?\n* Would they make stuff up?\n* Were they willing to say \"I don't know?\"\n* could they make a reasonable guess about how stuff should work?\n* Did they have a handle on how \"good\" they actually were?\n\nI've interviewed candidates who said things like, \"I've written thousands and thousands of lines of code\" (like that was necessarily a good thing) and I've found them terrible.\n\nWe started an interview with another person, who admitted to a bad night's sleep, and not having any food.  We stopped the interview.  Told the candidate they could go to the cafeteria, get some food, and relax.  We said, \"We're here all day.  Go to the front desk, ask for us when you're ready.\"... And we hired that person.\n\nIn all honesty, I don't think that a person who can solve a \"hard\" problem during an interview is what you need to find.  You need to find a person who, given the right environment, is capable of reasoning.",

It then traverses the shortest path, keeps track of the conversions it encounters and applies them when it's time to calculate. \n\nAs noted in the article it probably \"suffers\" from some extreme edge cases but I doubt anyone is interested in the 17th decimal when converting a cup of sugar.",

Research shows that there are two effective ways to screen candidates for job success: a general IQ test and a work-sample test. The former is barred from use in the United States because of discrimination reasons, so use the latter. That means having the candidate produce a sample of the work they will actually be doing. It's a simple idea; to best predict future behavior, observe the candidate under a similar set of circumstances. Unless your company's employees sit around solving algorithm puzzles all day, this type of question is not effective.

If a candidate doesn’t have the CS skills to know a graph problem when they see one, that’s a “not worth hiring” signal.*\n\nThis line put me off this article.  For a start,  the first assertion is not true.  In my experience,  most bootcamps *don't* teach graphs because they focus very heavily on how to build software in a specific toolchain. They know you can solve problems without a specific computer science approach for doing so. It doesn't have to be formally structured. \n\nSecondly,  it's really important to draw a distinction between not worth hiring and not worth hiring *for Google*. Maybe I should just assume that intent here,  but imo all this wording serves to do is increase imposter syndrome for many devs reading it.",

I'm not entirely sure what that order is, but my naive idea is to pick the two ratios closest in magnitude and multiply them to get one new ratio to replace them in the list, and repeat until there's only the one correct ratio left. OR maybe it would be to pick the two ratios that are the closest to being reciprocals, so the new ratio is as close to 1 as possible after each step.\n\nPS: Oh, and you could also cancel out ratios first. There's no reason to do `*3` in one place and `/3` in another place in the same chain of conversions.\n\nPPS: Of course, if you really were doing this at scale, you would pre-compute the most precise possible conversion between every two convertible units, so answering a query is just a single lookup and multiplication",
